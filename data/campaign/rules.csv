Luddic Church portmasters are somewhat rigid, are mostly loyal to their cause. However, they are mostly loyal to their CAUSE, and not faction, and sometimes have a tendency to have ulterior motives. It's for this reason that they are considered somewhat ""malleable"".
Like most portmasters, they are likely able to give you more lenience with lower stability, military presences, and higher reputation with both themselves and their faction, although tri-tachyon portmasters will be swayed more easily by bribes and personal reputation.",,

This person is acting _dismissive_ and _cold_ toward you, maintaining a demeanour of solid professionalism. Unless they're hiding something, it's unlikely they'll give you anything in this state.

Their reaction, if you continue, is highly dependant on many factors. Faction, personal reputation, faction reputation, condition of the market, condition of the system, the faction as a whole, your previous actions, and the list goes on and on.

Different factions will have wildly different reactions to this. Different personalities will also react differently. For example, a business-driven tri-tachyon quartermaster will rarely blow the whistle, however a stoic and loyal hegemony portmaster may.","1:SDE_BribeContinue:Continue with your speech
