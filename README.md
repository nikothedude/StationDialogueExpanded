# StationDialogueExpanded
starsector mod that expands apon station people

IM GOING TO FUCKING SPEEDRUN THIS MOD BEFORE 0.9.5

TO-DO: make basis of mod
write algorithms
decide on specific mechanics, maybe write design doc?
create version 0.0.1; extremely basic quartermaster functionality; all qms bound by same rules, above favorable personal rep unlock option for QM to give player supplies which causes minor deficit in supplies incoming for colony

END GOAL: complete overhaul of all station contacts; different jobs and ranks have different things you can do with them, different personalities, different ways to get on their side, different things they can do for you, different positions of authority. factions change how these people act. personal disposition, faction rep, colony stability, current sector events/system events, defense rating, every single factor in this game will be taken into account. nexerelin functionality as well as functionaity with many other mods. modding support for non-vanilla factions. 

IDEAS: be friends with administrator to loot ruins
