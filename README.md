# StationDialogueExpanded
This mod aims to completely overhaul the way the comms directory works and how you interact with the
people inside of it.

Outline: Comm contacts shouldn't be brute forceable, are very interconnected with sector
events, like invasions, pirate activity, shortages, player actions, how the player has interacted
with them, relations, fleet size, etc. Takes investment to get anything out of it, but the investment
is very worth it.

Each person will have a unique personality based off their voice, and potentially faction, importance,
rank, and potentially more. These personalities will affect your success rate in working with them,
how easy it is to get on their good side, what they want, what they will do, etc.

Each POST will have different attitudes in general. Postmasters and quartermasters, TRADE posts, will
be less loyal and more likely to be interested in a bribe and such. MILITARY posts will be the 
opposite, and will be harder on you. ADMIN posts are the hardest to get to, although not out of
strict loyalty, more of scrutiny. LEADER posts may not be touched. Ever. But if I make enough of
this, maybe.

Each POST will have different abilities. Portmasters, TRADE: Control customs control, oversees spaceport.
Potential options: Remove black market suspicion, redirect small amount of incoming shipments to you,
Quartermasters, TRADE: Keep stock and track of cargo and items in colony. Pot. opt: Smuggle resources from
market to your fleet, smuggle ships, weapons, market items, etc.
Station Commanders, MILITARY: Command the orbital station and oversee it's operation. Pot. ops:
Disable station (HIGH VALUE), lower station combat effectiveness (HIGH VALUE), reduce black market
suspicion, allow raiding/invasion force to bypass station (HIGH VALUE AND RISK), etc.
Base Commander, MILITARY: Commands the miltiary base on the colony. Pot. ops: Send away patrol fleets
from colony (suspicious to faction), disrupt ground defenses (if any), smuggle out marines/heavy armaments,
perform coup de'tat (EXTREMELY HIGH VALUE AND RISK, NEEDS SUPPORT)
Administrator, ADMIN: The administrator, oversees EVERYTHING, although has less power in areas where
someone already manages. Pot. ops: Disrupt any industry, smuggle anything, secede from parent faction
(VERY VERY VERY HIGH RISK AND VALUE)

Some POSTS will SHARE abilities. Almost every post will have power over every type of industry and
action, however some are better than others. All will be able to attempt to smuggle commoditties,
however only comiddities received or produced from the industries/structures they manage will
be acquired easily. 

The higher the value of an action, the more the person may want from you to complete it. This is
seperate from risk, as the motive for higher price comes from greed and not fear. Certain personalities
may value VALUE more than others, like a tri-tachyon aristocrat over a luddic faithful. The aristocrat
might demand 500000 credits to block suspicion, while a faithful might only ask for 20000, a prayer,
and a guarantee that you won't abuse it (and will hate you if you DO abuse it/come back for more).

The higher the RISK of an action, the less willing the person will be to do it in general. This
willingness is affected by their loyalty to their parent faction (normally). A soldier-voice hegemonic
base commander will tank your reputation with both themselves and their faction if you approach them
about disrupting ground defenses at the wrong time (the colony is stable, there are no defecits,
you arent cooperative with either them or their faction). However, a tri-tachyon business-type
administrator will only require you to be welcoming with them (and a donation of 500000 credits)
to accidentally overload the main firing array.

Repeated actions will have consequence no matter the personality. Even if someone is a corrupt
business-oriented tri-tach portmaster, they aren't loyal to YOU. Repeating actions to them will
cause prices to rise, and suspicion from their parent faction to rise as well. Actions may be
blocked. A loyal hegemony soldier may suddenly call a patrol directly on top of you and tank your
reputation if you're not careful.
